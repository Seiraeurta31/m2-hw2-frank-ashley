    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Ashley and I live with my husband, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. <br> 
        I grew up in North East Ohio for most of my life before moving <br>
        south to north east Florida in 2005 for a job opportunity my husband  <br>
        received and never looked back. I hate the cold. I freeze easily! <br> 
        LOL. I am a self taught graphic designer (15 years). I earned my <br> 
        Bachelors in Education in 2021, and am currently seeking my <br>
        Masters in Web Design.<br>

    <h2>Interests/Hobbies:</h2>
    <p>I enjoy being involved with my kids as much as I can when Iâ€™m not face <br>
        planted in schoolwork. I am heavily involved in Girl/Boy scouts (I am the  <br>
        troop leader for both my kids troops). I enjoy camping with my family and <br>
        spending time with our friends finding fun things to do locally on the weekends. <br>
